      There are some punctuations that are interesting and there are some
      punctuations that are not. Let us begin with the punctuations that are
      not. Of these the one but the first and the most the completely most
      uninteresting is the
      <span class="change" data-hover="question mark">[?]</span>. The
      <span class="change" data-hover="question mark">[?]</span> is alright when
      it is all alone when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be
      used in decoration but connected with writing it is completely entirely
      completely uninteresting. It is evident that is you ask a question you ask
      a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a
      question as it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you therefore
      wherefore should one use the
      <span class="change" data-hover="question mark">[?]</span>. Beside it does
      not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the
      eye nor the ear and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name
      of something. A question is a question, anybody can know that a question
      is a question and so why add to it the
      <span class="change" data-hover="question mark">[?]</span> when it is
      already there when the question is already there in the writing. Therefore
      I never could bring myself to use a
      <span class="change" data-hover="question mark">[?]</span>, I always found
      it positively revolting, and now very few do use it. Exclamation marks
      have the same difficulty and also quotation marks, they are unnecessary,
      they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the printing and
      anyway what is the use, if you do not know that a question is a question
      what is the use of its being a question. The same thing is true of a
      quotation. When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to use
      <span class="change" data-hover="question mark">[?]</span> and quotation
      marks and exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps
      some day they will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can
      and does see it that way. So there are the uninteresting things in
      punctuation uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious, and so we do
      not have to go any farther into that. There are besides dashes and dots,
      and these might be interesting spaces might be interesting. They might if
      one felt that way about them.
