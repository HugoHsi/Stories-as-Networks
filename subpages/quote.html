      Exclamation marks have the same difficulty and also
      <span class="change" data-hover="quotation marks">["]</span>, they are
      unnecessary, they are ugly, they spoil the line of the writing or the
      printing and anyway what is the use, if you do not know that a question is
      a question what is the use of its being a question. The same thing is true
      of a quotation. When I first began writing I found it simply impossible to
      use question marks and
      <span class="change" data-hover="quotation marks">["]</span> and
      exclamation points and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps some day they
      will see it some other way but not at any rate anybody can and does see it
      that way.
