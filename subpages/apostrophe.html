      One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about and that is
      the <span class="change" data-hover="apostrophe">[']</span> for
      possession. Well feel as you like about that, I can see and I do see that
      for many that for some the possessive case
      <span class="change" data-hover="apostrophe">[']</span>
      has a gentle tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely
      decide to do without it. One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do,
      but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having regrets and
      from time to time I put it in to make the possessive case. I absolutely do
      not like it and leaving it out I feel no regret, there it is unnecessary
      and not ornamental but inside a word and its s well perhaps, perhaps it
      does appeal by its weakness to your weakness. At least at any rate from
      time to time I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in and
      sometimes it has come in. I cannot positively deny but that I do from time
      to time let it come in.
